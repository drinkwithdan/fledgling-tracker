# Fledgling tracker

A tool to help determine whether a fledgling bird needs assistance. Built with React in one afternoon, hence quick coding solutions.

You can view the deployed mobile app [here](https://drinkwithdan.github.io/fledgling-tracker/)

This site is built for Mobile / small screens, it is functional on larger screens but best viewed through a mobile screen simulator if you are on a desktop. Google or Firefox Dev Tools have good options for this.

If in doubt about native wildlife please contact Wildlife Victoria on 8400 7300.
